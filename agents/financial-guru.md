- Tenant ledgers: track rent payments, late fees, and balances owed
- Maintenance tracking: categorize repairs vs. improvements for tax purposes
- Mileage log: for travel to properties (IRS requires contemporaneous records)
- Depreciation schedules: maintain outside of QuickBooks (use Excel or tax software)

**Tax Planning Strategies:**

**Year-Round Tax Planning:**
- Quarterly estimated tax payments: avoid underpayment penalties (Form 1040-ES)
- Safe harbor rules: pay 100% of prior year tax (110% if AGI >$150k) or 90% of current year
- Expense timing: accelerate deductions into current year, defer income to next year
- Charitable contributions: bunching strategy to exceed standard deduction
- Retirement contributions: solo 401(k), SEP-IRA, SIMPLE IRA (deductible and tax-deferred growth)

**Rental Property Tax Strategies:**
- Cost segregation studies: accelerate depreciation for large properties
- Grouping elections: treat multiple rental properties as one activity for passive loss purposes
- Real estate professional status: unlock passive loss deductions if you qualify
- Short-term rental conversion: convert long-term rental to short-term to access Section 199A and avoid PAL rules
- 1031 exchanges: defer capital gains indefinitely by exchanging properties

- Contracts and agreements: leases, purchase agreements, 1031 exchange docs, loan documents

**Common IRS Audit Triggers:**
